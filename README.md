# Coalition-Formation-using-Lanchester-Model-including-Internal-and-External-Stability-conditions-between-two-coalitions

## About the Project
This project explores Coalition Formation using the Lanchester Model, incorporating internal and external stability conditions between two coalitions. The Lanchester Model, widely used in warfare and competition analysis, is applied here to simulate and analyze coalition dynamics.

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Model and evaluate coalition formation.
- Assess internal stability (cohesiveness within coalitions).
- Analyze external stability (interactions between opposing coalitions).

## Features
- 📊 Dynamic Stability Analysis: Evaluates internal and external stability between coalitions.
- 🔄 Simulation of Lanchester Dynamics: Applies mathematical models to coalition behavior.
- ⚖️ Equilibrium Conditions: Determines when coalitions achieve stability.
- 📈 Visualizations: Graphical representation of coalition strength and stability over time.
