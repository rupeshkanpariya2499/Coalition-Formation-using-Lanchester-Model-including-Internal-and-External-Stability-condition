# Coalition-Formation-using-Lanchester-Model-including-Internal-and-External-Stability-conditions-between-two-coalitions

## About the Project
This project explores Coalition Formation using the Lanchester Model, incorporating internal and external stability conditions between two coalitions. The Lanchester Model, widely used in warfare and competition analysis, is applied here to simulate and analyze coalition dynamics.

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Model and evaluate coalition formation.
- Assess internal stability (cohesiveness within coalitions).
- Analyze external stability (interactions between opposing coalitions).
